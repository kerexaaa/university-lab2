          I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Who's brave enough to fly
          into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Meh. And until
          then, I can never die? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter
          who you are pretending to be.

          Oh yeah, good luck with that. I haven't felt much of anything since my
          guinea pig died. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring
          off his cold, dead finger. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence
          never solved anything.
